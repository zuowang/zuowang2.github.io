## Summary

5 years of experience building scalable high performance data warehouses systems, with expertise in query optimization, vectorized execution and columnar storage format. Strong HW knowledge, good understanding of the effects imposed by the system at all levels (CPU, memory, network, I/O, OS, queuing effect, storage, etc.), optimization for multi core. Strong programming skills in C++, Java, Python, Golang, Javascript, HQL, PL/SQL and other script language. Extensive experience with root causing and quantifying performance issues across the stack.

## Past Work

Optimize ApacheImpala with AVX2: vectorized query execution, batch operates of bitmap filter. The speedup for bitmap operators is 7.1X(get), 4.0X(or), 3.5X(and), 5.6X(set). Invented new compression technology for Parquet format file and new ways to evaluate predicates on encoded data. The speedup is 2.6X ~ 3.8X for compression and 6X ~ 19X for decompression. The speedup for TPC-H queries is 2.14X (q6), 1.47X (q13), 2.0X(q14), 1.45X(q15), 1.32X(q20). Co-presented the work at Strata Hadoop NYC. Implemented ByteSwap with AVX2, the speedup is 10.7X ~ 38.6X. Led the investigation, algorithm design, and benchmark in AVX sort project. Invented a new approach to encode integer into double so that merge times reduced to at most once. With this new approach, the speedup of AVX sort is more than 3X. Involvement and leadership in projects: In-depth investigated into cache-aware hash join, Crystal Ridge memory, parallelism on multi-cores, lock elision with RTM and HLE. write technique reports and proposals. Contribute to patches to Apache Impala: Patches relates to UDF, compiler, security, frontend and backend of Impala. Research on the state-of-art database technologies: Morsel-Driven Parallelism, seastar framework(for high performance OLTP work), RDMA
